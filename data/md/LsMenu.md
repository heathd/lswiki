Five conventional structures guide the way we organize routine interactions and how groups work together: presentations, managed discussions, open discussions, status reports and brainstorm sessions. Liberating Structures '''add 33 more options''' to the big five conventional approaches.

<blockquote>'''Any one LS can change a meeting. Together they can liberate and transform an entire organization.'''
</blockquote>

The menu below represents version 2.2 of Liberating Structures.  If you are new to LS, we recommend that you start practicing with the simplest (e.g., [[1-1-2-4-all/|1-2-4-All]], [[2-impromptu-networking/|Impromptu Networking]]), starting from the top left and moving to the most intricate at the bottom right ([[32-panarchy/|Panarchy]], [[33-purpose-to-practice-p2p/|Purpose-To-Practice]]). The more intricate methods use many of the simpler LS as building blocks. Read [[design-elements/|Microstructures &amp; Design Elements]] to learn more about how they work.   '''Click on any Liberating Structure below.'''

<blockquote>Liberating Structures inject tiny shifts in the protocols of how we meet, plan, decide and relate to each other that put in the hands of everyone the facilitative power once reserved for experts only.

The [[storage/articles-nascent-ls/LS%20Selection%20Matchmaker%20v%209.pdf|LS Selection Matchmaker]] is a simple way to get started on your first string of Liberating Structures.  

[[File:/storage/Selection%20Matchmaker.jpg|link=File:LS Selection Matchmaker v 9.pdf]]

'''Not enough selection?'''  If you want join in field testing new [[ls-discussion/|LS-In-Development]], there are more very promising microstructures [[ls-discussion/|here]].  These are prototypes that need more field testing and vetting in multiple settings.

Need help liberating virtual meetings? [[storage/articles-nascent-ls/DESIGN%20of%20LIBERATED%20VIRTUAL%20MEETINGS%20v2.pdf|Design checklist here]].  Most LS can be adapted for use with virtual conferencing technology platforms.
